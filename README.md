PRECISION MACHINE CHALLENGE<br>
Precision Machine Service, established in 1972, was using YP.com for their marketing services and website, and experiencing less than satisfactory results. The client wanted to rebuild their website, rank the site organically in Google and increase the number of phone calls/leads for the business. Client also asked marketing $s be under what they were spending with YP. 
<br><br>
We first started by assisting the client take back control of their domain name from YP. We built the new site specifically to showcase their services, attract new leads and rank organically in the Jacksonville market. After the website design and SEO campaign was finalized, we suggested a 2 month Google & Bing Ads campaign as a “trial run” for the client.
 
<br><br>

Our team started with a brand new website and new logo, put together a cabinet catalog for their site and devised a sales funnel for catalog downloads. Through a modest monthly Google and Bing Ad budget, we also pushed a large volume of qualified traffic to their site.
